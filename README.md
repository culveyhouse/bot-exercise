# Whozoo-Exercise

## Synopsis

This small repository contains the Node.js app and supporting files that I wrote for my whozoo-exercise project. The project uses several technologies to emulate a chat bot in a serverless stack. The tools I used for this exercise are listed below. 

## Built With

* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/docs/) - The primary runtime used
* [MS Bot Builder SDK for Node.js](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/bot-framework/nodejs/bot-builder-nodejs-overview#get-started) - The bot builder used to develop the simple bot in this exercise
* [Bot Framework Channel Emulator](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/bot-framework/debug-bots-emulator) - A desktop application for rapid development and debugging of this bot
* [Firebase Realtime Database](https://firebase.google.com/docs/database/) and [Cloud Functions](https://firebase.google.com/docs/functions/) (hosted by Google) - The serverless NoSQL database used in this example
* [Firebase SDK for Cloud Functions](https://firebase.google.com/docs/functions/get-started) - The Node.js module which allows development and deployment of Firebase Cloud Functions

## Installation 

### Clone or download Git repository
1. Create the folder whozoo-exercise or let 

### Node.js and Bot Builder SDK
1. Depending upon your OS, you must install Node.js per the instructions for your Windows, MacOS, and Unix/Linux: [Node.js Downloads](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) 
2. After installing Node.js, use the MS Bot Builder instructions under "Prerequisites" to initialize the Node package manager (npm), here: [MS Bot Builder Quickstart](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/bot-framework/nodejs/bot-builder-nodejs-quickstart#prerequisites)
3. Be sure to create a folder where this project will be run. 
3. Now install the Bot Builder SDK per the instructions on that same page.
