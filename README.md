# Whozoo-Exercise

## Synopsis

This small repository contains the Node.js app and supporting files that I wrote for my whozoo-exercise project. The project uses several technologies to emulate a chat bot in a serverless stack. The tools I used for this exercise are listed below. 

## Built With

* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/docs/) - The primary runtime used
* [MS Bot Builder SDK for Node.js](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/bot-framework/nodejs/bot-builder-nodejs-overview#get-started) - The bot builder used to develop the simple bot in this exercise
* [Bot Framework Channel Emulator](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/bot-framework/debug-bots-emulator) - A desktop application for rapid development and debugging of this bot
* [Firebase Realtime Database](https://firebase.google.com/docs/database/) and [Cloud Functions](https://firebase.google.com/docs/functions/) (hosted by Google) - The serverless NoSQL database used in this example
* [Firebase SDK for Cloud Functions](https://firebase.google.com/docs/functions/get-started) - The Node.js module which allows development and deployment of Firebase Cloud Functions
